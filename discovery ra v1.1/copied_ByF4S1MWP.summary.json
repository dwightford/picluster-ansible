With that information, you can identify patterns and trends and gain insights that drive better decision-making.</p>\n<p>Imagine having all of the data that you need to answer questions. The Watson Discovery service can process data from various sources, including Microsoft® Word, PDF, HTML, and JSON documents. Processing occurs in several ways:\n</p><ul><li>With APIs, you can upload content by using an application or create a custom upload mechanism.</li><li>With discovery tooling, you can upload locally accessible files for configuration and testing.</li><li>With Data Crawler, you can upload of a large number of files from a \nsupported repository, such as an IBM® DB2® database, by using the \ncommand line.</li></ul>Both publicly available data and your enterprise-specific data are processed and then enriched to be used by your application. Data enrichment provides a collection of text analysis functions that derive semantic information from your content. You can provide text, HTML, or a public URL and use natural language-processing techniques to get a high-level understanding of your content and obtain detailed insights, such as directional sentiment from entity to object. Enrichment extracts entities, relationships, keywords, sentiments, and more.<br><br><p>After the data is processed and enriched, it’s securely stored and available to only your application. In addition to the private enterprise data that you include for use by your application, you can tap into pre-enriched data sets that are publicly available, such as the Discovery News collection. Discovery News includes primarily \nEnglish-language news sources that are updated continuously, with over 300,000 new articles and blogs added daily from more than 100,000 sources.</p>\n<p>The Watson Discovery service provides search capabilities through queries. The search engine finds matching documents from the processed data. Then, the engine applies a formula that provides relevance scoring to return the best answer to the query. When an application uses the Watson Discovery service, the people who use that application can gain insight from textual data. These examples are typical:\n</p><ul><li><p>Customer service applications that support a workflow to find and deliver the answers to complex customer questions</p></li><li><p>Social media and news channel applications that provide real-time\n visibility to perceptions about products, services, and brands, and \nthen correlate today’s results with historical results</p></li><li><p>Research applications that extract consolidated industry and \ndomain-specific insights from vast numbers of research and other \ndocuments.</p></li></ul>Provide insights by using a powerful cognitive engine<br><br>Businesses that build applications by using Watson Discovery benefit in several ways:<br><br><ul><li>    Deliver applications that integrate the natural language processing (NLP), search, analytics, and machine learning capabilities from the Discovery service.</li><li>    Use APIs or tools to make your data, third-party data, and public data available for use in your application.</li><li>    Keep your data secure and private.</li></ul><ul><li>    Use a powerful cognitive engine to comb through vast amounts of data to provide answers to questions, detect trends and patterns, and provide insights that are surfaced through your application.</li></ul><br><div>To learn more about building such applications, see the Discovery reference architecture.<b><br></b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Cognitive discovery concepts</b></div><br>To better understand Watson Discovery concepts, consider this example:<br><br>Millions of people fly every day. As travelers prepare for their flights, questions frequently arise about everything from what they can bring on the plane to rules about security procedures. To improve customer service, an airline can develop an application by using the Watson Discovery service to answer customers' questions.<br><br>To develop an air-travel concierge application, the cognitive team identifies the types of questions that the application must be able to address. Then, the data scientist works with the knowledge engineer to collect the data that can be used to answer the questions.<br><br>An air-travel concierge application likely needs to include any FAA rules that apply to customer travel. An airline might also have airline-specific rules and guidelines. The data team uses APIs and tools to process and enrich the data for the application. In parallel, application developers develop a web app that customers can use to ask their questions and receive responses.<br><br><div>When the application is ready, the airline customers can ask questions, which are sent via the application logic to the Watson Discovery service. The service processes the queries and returns results to customers through the web app.</div><div><br></div>For additional resources on this architecture, see - https://www.ibm.com/cloud/architecture/architectures/cognitiveDiscoveryDomain","tag":[{"name":"Cognitive","_id":"tag_tech_cognitive"},{"name":"Cognitive Customer Insight & Engagement","_id":"tag_industry_cognitive_customer_insight_engagement"}],"schemaVersion":"1.2","clientName":"","lastModifiedUser":{"_id":"glcraig@us.ibm.com","fullname":"Gary Craig","notesId":"Gary Craig","jobResponsibilities":"Consultant -- Technical Enablement","avatar":"https://w3-services1.w3-969.ibm.com/myw3/unified-profile-photo/v1/image/glcraig@us.ibm.com?def=avatar","privacyConstent":{"isAccept":true,"country":"US","acceptedDate":"2017-12-29T13:49:15.365Z"},"lastLoginDate":"2020-07-30T15:32:21.592Z","bookmarkedArchList":["copied_e46c1250_ad56_11e7_9df4_2b1f6b893765_COPY_architecture_6ce61071_8d01_11e7_a90b_697746ae2b06","architecture_ce773461_818d_11e7_88e7_21ec9eeb2850","arch_H1XLTgYRz","copied_0050ba20_ad57_11e7_971d_1dbaf50a3a74_COPY_architecture_ab8c2831_a7e8_11e7_8703_cf7fc382471f","architecture_BJpFTNPnQ","arch_SkSV-wOWV","copied_c7d6c370_a427_11e7_9030_55bdb397af46_COPY_architecture_a3903cc1_8db7_11e7_a90b_697746ae2b06","architecture_e7926e01_8ea9_11e7_931e_555f613a0ec4","copied_17e0e030_a428_11e7_b2b8_47a1ea2c680b_COPY_architecture_6dd14e01_8db5_11e7_a90b_697746ae2b06","copied_f5982c40_a427_11e7_9b2d_bf96ebf8b1f3_COPY_architecture_33869491_8dbe_11e7_a90b_697746ae2b06","copied_02fe75c0_a427_11e7_b7a9_bbced10d30d5_COPY_architecture_9abc5771_8d1a_11e7_a90b_697746ae2b06"],"chatbotToken":"f0bdad7fac6c4410845e538772982e3b","username":"glcraig@us.ibm.com","email":"glcraig@us.ibm.com","userPreference":{"defaultTemplate":"template_company_ibm","defaultGithubInfo":{"_id":null,"repoUrl":"git@github.ibm.com:glcraig/CogArch-Archives.git"}},"geographyList":["897"],"businessUnitList":["GLMKT"],"collaborationGroupList":["5b75ceb39ed6be0008efd9fd","5cdd7a31142df200086b2666","5cefa5cad2224300087412ce","5cfe3e84d222430008741419","5d136b3a81dbc100085a295f"]},"owner":{"_id":"glcraig@us.ibm.com","fullname":"Gary Craig","notesId":"Gary Craig","jobResponsibilities":"Consultant -- Technical Enablement","avatar":"https://w3-services1.w3-969.ibm.com/myw3/unified-profile-photo/v1/image/glcraig@us.ibm.com?def=avatar","privacyConstent":{"isAccept":true,"country":"US","acceptedDate":"2017-12-29T13:49:15.365Z"},"lastLoginDate":"2020-07-30T15:32:21.592Z","bookmarkedArchList":["copied_e46c1250_ad56_11e7_9df4_2b1f6b893765_COPY_architecture_6ce61071_8d01_11e7_a90b_697746ae2b06","architecture_ce773461_818d_11e7_88e7_21ec9eeb2850","arch_H1XLTgYRz","copied_0050ba20_ad57_11e7_971d_1dbaf50a3a74_COPY_architecture_ab8c2831_a7e8_11e7_8703_cf7fc382471f","architecture_BJpFTNPnQ","arch_SkSV-wOWV","copied_c7d6c370_a427_11e7_9030_55bdb397af46_COPY_architecture_a3903cc1_8db7_11e7_a90b_697746ae2b06","architecture_e7926e01_8ea9_11e7_931e_555f613a0ec4","copied_17e0e030_a428_11e7_b2b8_47a1ea2c680b_COPY_architecture_6dd14e01_8db5_11e7_a90b_697746ae2b06","copied_f5982c40_a427_11e7_9b2d_bf96ebf8b1f3_COPY_architecture_33869491_8dbe_11e7_a90b_697746ae2b06","copied_02fe75c0_a427_11e7_b7a9_bbced10d30d5_COPY_architecture_9abc5771_8d1a_11e7_a90b_697746ae2b06"],"chatbotToken":"f0bdad7fac6c4410845e538772982e3b","username":"glcraig@us.ibm.com","email":"glcraig@us.ibm.com","userPreference":{"defaultTemplate":"template_company_ibm","defaultGithubInfo":{"_id":null,"repoUrl":"git@github.ibm.com:glcraig/CogArch-Archives.git"}},"collaborationGroupList":["5b75ceb39ed6be0008efd9fd","5cdd7a31142df200086b2666","5cefa5cad2224300087412ce","5cfe3e84d222430008741419","5d136b3a81dbc100085a295f"],"businessUnit":{"_id":"GLMKT","name":"IBM Global Markets","description":""},"geography":{"_id":"897","iot":"North America IOT","imt_market":"US","country":"United States of America"}},"appVersion":"2.9.1"}
